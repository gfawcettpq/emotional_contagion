# Emotion Contagion Project Journal

> *"We're camping outside the realms of the unknown and catching what comes up. We're sitting on the edge of probability with a million monkeys, and sometimes some good shit comes our way, and it's fucking amazing."*

This journal chronicles the development of an emotion contagion simulation using an AI verification lockdown strategy. We're building in the open, documenting the good, the weird, and the breakthrough moments.

## 2025-07-26 19:37:49 EDT - Project Genesis & Lockdown Architecture

**MILESTONE**: Initialized the AI verification lockdown system for emotion contagion project

What happened:
- Set up three-phase development structure (Specs → Test → Implementation)
- Created mode-switching scripts with human verification (math problems to prevent AI tampering)
- Built directory structure specifically for Rust project with proper test organization
- Started implementing the verification framework from the AI restrictions spec

**Cool shit discovered:**
- The lockdown system forces AI to make structured, quantifiable claims instead of vague "it works" assertions
- Human verification via math problems is a elegant way to prevent AI from switching modes autonomously
- Phase-based development with immutable specs creates genuine accountability

**Architecture decisions:**
- Using Rust + macroquad for performance (no JavaScript overhead)
- BDD features for user-facing behavior verification
- Separate unit/integration/performance test directories
- Immutable specs directory that gets locked down after design phase

**Next up**: Finish setting up verification framework, then lock down specs mode and transition to test mode.
